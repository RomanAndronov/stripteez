A strip of paper two to the power of n sequentially numbered unit squares long
is placed on a table in such a way that its left-most square, numbered as 1,
is fixed at origin in the XOY plane.

The strip then undergoes 'n' like transformations as follows:

- the strip is folded in half upward and its current right-most square is
rotated counterclockwise 180 degrees in the ZOX plane about the current
strip's middle until it is placed on top of the strip's left-most square

After the n-th fold is complete, the strip is one square-long along the OX axis
with two to the power of n squares piled one on top of the other along the OZ
axis*:

- if n = 1 fold is performed then the initial length of the strip is 2 and at
the end of the transformation the distribution of numbers in a vertical
direction is:

1 2

- if n = 2 folds are performed then the initial length of the strip is 4 and
at the end of the transformation the distribution of numbers in a vertical
direction is:

1 4 3 2

- for n = 3 folds:

1 8 5 4 3 6 7 2

- for n = 4 folds:

1 16 9 8 5 12 13 4 3 14 11 6 7 10 15 2

- for n = 5 folds:

1 32 17 ...

and so on.

- what type(s) of toy model emulating the actual folding process can be thought
of?

- given a square in the original strip numbered with the current year, what will
its position be in the folded strip after 30 folds?

Another way to obtain the new sequence of numbers is as follows: holding the
folded strip by its 'book' end, cut all the forward facing folds, thumb through
the 'pages' to reveal their numbers.
