/*
  Solution: literal.

   Every number has two immediate neighbors - above and below. Initially,
   numbers have no neighbors. The actual folding of a strip is split
   across two stages:

   - moving horizontally to pair up each remaining strip's 'left' column
     (located in the left half) with the corresponding 'right' column
     (located in the right half) that will soon be placed on top of the
     'left' column

   - moving vertically through the folded layers to connect the stack of
     numbers in the 'left' column to the stack of numbers in the
     corresponding 'right' column where 'connecting' means reversing the
     order of numbers in the 'right' column since they are being turned
     up side down as a result of folding/rotating

  argv[ 1 ] is the number of folds to perform
